selling_point_intro1: Investing in a cheap website will result more expensive!
selling_point_intro2: Let's see the reasons why it's convenient to work with us.
selling_point_01:
  title: Speed
  subtitle: A fast website is absolutely necessary today.
  text: Why spend when i can have a Wordpress website done for cheap or even do it myself? Well, there are many reasons why you better invest in a fast website. Statistic shows that if your website loads slower than 5 seconds you're probably loosing from 30% to 50% of your visitors. Create a segment in you Google Analytics and see how many visitors stay less that 15 seconds (the average time for a WP site to became interactive).
selling_point_02:
  title: Security and SEO
  subtitle: Google ranks https sites higher.
  text: Not only because local providers can, and do, inject scripts and ads into http traffic, but most importantly cos you will get a higher ranking when you have SSL properly installed and your site is served via https. All our packages include https/SSL feature. We use all the best SEO practices to have each of your webpages showing up on social media complete with a large image, a title and a short text. (Try copy and paste this page's URL into a WhatsApp chat for example...)
selling_point_03:
  title: Global CDN hosting
  subtitle: Forget about hosting bills and server problems and management.
  text: All our packages include hosting on a global CDN. This means that copies of you site exist in various servers strategically located to cover the world. The closest server is the one that will deliver thew website. This cuts loading time by half on average. (Each package offer includes setup and 2 years CDN hosting and maintenance, after that it's 49 euro per year)
selling_point_04:
  title: Beautiful art belongs to the museum.
  subtitle: To compete today we need performance.
  text: After you get the performance, you better match user expectations. So, menu position, footer informations, navigation styles need to be where, and behave as, most users are used to. After that, there is room for creativity. But not really... we have to be concise and straight to the point. The attention span of our users is really short. This is why you better hire a pro web-designer rather than an artist. You better focus on what users need rather that what you like. Both our templates and the custom websites that we build are developed upon these principles... and results show.
