<small><em>The Problem</em></small>:<br>
Proprietary software locks you in. Rising subscription costs, **vendor dependencies**, and **zero control** over your **critical tools**.

<small><em>The Solution</em></small>:<br>
**Go open source.** Build on transparent foundations we all can inspect, modify, and own forever. Leverage **thriving communities** that innovate faster than any corporation.

<small><em>Why It Matters</em></small>:

- **Freedom**: No vendor lock-in or surprise price hikes.
- **Security**: Thousands of eyes catching bugs before you do.
- **Longevity**: Your tools survive even if companies don't.

Ready to own your stack? Open source gives you **true digital independence**.
