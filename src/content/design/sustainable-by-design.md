Build for easy maintainance.

Entreprenuers should avoid repetitive tasks, delegate, and be able to just focus.

That's the idea, in real life, it's hard to avoid getting sucked in executing a certern task, just cos you havent found the right person to trust with that.

Simplify your company software needs. Free your time by delegating. **Automate** recurring everyday-tasks.

You want to step-up **Anti-fragility**, to lead and explore you first have to free you schedule.

An Artisasal Family Run Shop can't scale, and can't be sold.

Start with time consuming, energy absorbing tasks. Social Content Production! Hard to do without, today!

**Feel these needs?** That's when you want to **pivot**.

We bring **the joy of out-sourcing**, a manager's life-saver.

We design for a Low Consumption. Sustainable Web, helping the planet.
