The **_Creative Process_** can indeed be overwhelming. The **_Adjacent Possible_** is not easy to spot.

Are you having difficulties figuring it all out on your own? We can help. **We offer Guidance**.

Junglestar founder has been **immagining** and **managing creative processes** in the [marketing communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_communications) field for more than 30 years.

Beginning from setting project goals, audience and environment with client, we start. Research → Immagine → Design → Production → Monitor → Update → Maintain.

Wanna do it on your own, sweat the details, tha's ok too. We can show you shortcuts and the best path to take. Starting from **defining the big picture and options together**, before we even start executing. Undoing a plan is easier than undoing action. That's why **planning pays off**.

In this **fast-changing** world, where everything is **short-lasting**, it’s all about **how quickly** you can **produce** [well thought solutions](/offer). That's why **streamlining** repetitive tasks is **paramount**.

We have been helping small companies for many years.
